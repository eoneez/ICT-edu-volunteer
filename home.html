              <div class="beginning"> What our team members have in common is that they are attending <br> Sungshin Women's University. 
              And another thing in common is that <br> we belong to an in-school club called SCC. <br><br>
               SCC stands for Sungshin Cumpeter Club and is the oldest computer club <br>
              in Sungshin Women's University. We met for the first time in this club's <br>
              Python study. As we studied Python together, we became closer and shared <br>
              many things together. We went on a trip to Gapyeong, Gyeonggi-do <br>
              and ate a lot of delicious food together. <br> <br>
               In the meantime, I wanted to spend a meaningful summer together. <br>
               All of our team members had that idea. We just found out that <br>
               the WFK ICT volunteer group is recruiting a team. Our team participated <br>
               in this without delay. We named our team "PICK ME" in the hope that more <br>
               people will focus on our team. We are already excited to spend this <br>
               summer meaningfully!</div>

                <h2>The goal for this program</h2>

                <img src="image/myanmar.jpg">

                <div class="goal"> <br>Our team's goal this time is to deliver as much as we can to the <br>
                students as we can. This is the original purpose of the WFK ICT Volunteer Group. <br><br>
                Closing the global information gap is the goal and reason for this activity. <br>
                We are joined by the students in Myanmar. Myanmar has long been interested in <br>
                the country because it is famous for its golden country and beautiful <br> 
                natural environment. <br><br>
                I am very happy to be able to communicate directly with the people of Myanmar <br> 
                and exchange with them. In this activity, we would like to exchange various things<br>
                with each other and know more about Myanmar in detail and reality rather than <br>
                unilaterally delivering information and introducing Korea. <br><br>
                 I hope that small exchanges between Korea and Myanmar will <br>
                 remain a good memory for each other.</div>
